# The King's Table
A new Cave Story editor, designed to work with everything that came before, and everything that ever could happen after.

Please excuse the mess, this editor is only *just* in a state where you can use it to edit all of CS, so it's very liable to crashing, and is missing a lot of features.

In the future there will be more of a description here, but for now, I'm assuming you're here to build this for yourself.

# Building
It's just a regular VS 2019 file, it should build pretty normally.

Current Target is .NET Framework 4.8, but in the future this may lower to 4.6, and add an option for building with .NET 5.

That said, it has a LOT of other projects you'll need to download too

- [LayeredPictureBox](https://github.com/Brayconn/LayeredPictureBox)
- [PixelModdingFramework](https://github.com/Brayconn/PixelModdingFramework)
- [PETools](https://github.com/Brayconn/PETools) 
  - Make sure you use my overhaul, and not the original broken/super old parent repo.
- [LocalizeableComponentModel](https://github.com/Brayconn/LocalizeableComponentModel)
- [WinFormsKeybinds](https://github.com/Brayconn/WinFormsKeybinds)

I hope to reduce the amount of libraries you need to download in the future.
