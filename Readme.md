# The King's Table
A new Cave Story editor, designed to work with everything that came before, and everything that ever could happen after.

Built on .NET 6/Avalonia for a smooth experience on every OS™

In the future there will be more of a description here, but for now it's just build/run instructions.


# Running
First, make sure you actually have [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed.
For Windows you'll want the ".NET Desktop Runtime", for all other OSes get the ".NET Runtime".

Now you're ready to download the program from the ~~releases~~ [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/brayconn/thekingstable/artifacts/Release.zip) page.

After you've extracted the zip contents, the next step depends on your OS:

## Windows
Extract and run `TheKingsTable.exe`!

## Mac/Linux
Extract and run `TheKingsTable.dll`!

...This took way too long to figure out the first time...


# Building
It's just a regular Visual Studio solution file, it should build pretty normally.

Just make sure you download [CaveStoryModdingFramework](https://github.com/Brayconn/CaveStoryModdingFramework) and all its dependencies too.
